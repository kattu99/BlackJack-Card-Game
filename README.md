# INTENSE BLACKJACK Game

Instructions for running your code:
You follow the instructions on the console and make your bets.

My goal when designing the game: 
To make it fast paced and addictive. It's really fun to try to beat the game as you can play it at a very fast pace and keep trying to outsmart the dealer by betting extremely large amounts of money. 

System Design Decisions:
I chose to keep the code modular into different functions that dealt with the deck and finding the sum of the hand.
