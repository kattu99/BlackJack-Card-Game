# INTENSE BLACKJACK Game

## Instructions for running my code:
You follow the instructions on the console and make your bets.

## My goal when designing the game: 
To make it fast paced and addictive. It's really fun to try to beat the game as you can play it at a very fast pace and keep trying to outsmart the dealer by betting extremely large amounts of money. 

## Libraries:
For ease of use, I have used only time and random in python. They're built-in topython and therefore don't need extra libraries to be installed. This enhances the user's experience and makes it easier to play. 

## System Design Decisions:
An issue I faced was accounting for edge cases in my program. I realized that a good way of doing it would be to just present the same prompt again to maintain the same pace. I chose to keep the code modular into different functions that dealt with the deck and finding the sum of the hand.
